# Inspiration

With the rise in usage of microservices, Making http requests is essential job of most devs. For these, there are multiple options like curl, insomnia postman. My Ideal choice is to use curl but problems with it is, having no history and no easy way to save and rerun. Postman solves that problem, but once user logs in(earlier it used to be optional, now its mandatory), it stores all request metadata(body/headers/urls/credentails) to their servers although it helps solve using it across multiple devices, backup but it could be potential security loop hole if they can access it. (now a days, postman desktop is super slow also).

This project aims to solve save&reuse requests, maintaining history and no sync in proprietery servers (although you can achive sync via commiting http files into git).

## GOAL

dothttp will provide simple, cleaner architecture for making http requests. It uses xtext (eclipse developed dsl) to build a custom dsl.

# http file can have multiple requests, name tag/annotation is used to identify

? projection, org
? projection, location




# makes are post request, with url `https://req.dothttp.dev/user`

## KICKSTART

### From pypi

```shell
pip install dothttp-req==0.0.10
```

### From source

```shell
git clone git@github.com:cedric05/dothttp.git
cd dothttp

python3 -m pip install pipenv
pipenv install
```

### python3.9

```shell
python3 -m dothttp examples/dothttpazure.http
```

### docker

```shell
docker build -t dothttp .
docker run -it --rm dothttp
```

### whalebrew

```shell
docker run -it --rm dothttp
```

## Features

1. easy and cleaner http syntax
1. variable substitution with property file
1. generates curl from http for easy sharing

```shell
docker build -t dothttp .
whalebrew install dothttp
dothttp examples/dothttpazure.http
```

## First DotHttpRequest and more

```get.http
GET "http://localhost:8000/get"
```

`dothttp get.http`  or `python -m dothttp get.http`

## Run

`dothttp simple.http`

prints

```json
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept-Encoding": "identity",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "python-urllib3/1.26.3",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-6022266a-20fb552e530ba3d90c75be6d"
  },
  "origin": "117.216.243.24",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/get"
}
```

### POST request

```post.http
POST "http://localhost:8000/post"
```

```json
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept-Encoding": "identity",
    "Content-Length": "0",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "python-urllib3/1.26.3",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-602228fa-3c3ed5213b6d8c2d2a223148"
  },
  "json": null,
  "origin": "117.216.243.24",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/post"
}
```

similarly, other methods`GET, POST, OPTIONS, DELETE, CONNECT, PUT, HEAD, TRACE` support is available.

### Query

query params can be added to request by specifying
` query ( "key", "value")`
` ?  "key", "value"`
` ? "key": "value"`
` ? "key"= "value"`
all four are accepted. going with `query("hi", "hi2)` is more readable. `?"key"= "value"` is more concise

### Payload

user can specify payload by mentioning below four forms (for various scenarios).

- `data("ram")`

  user can also mention its `content-type` with
  `data("ram", "text/plain")`
- `data({"key": "value"})` for form input.
- `json({"key": "value"})` for json payload.
- `fileinput("path/to/file", "type")` uploads file as payload (type is optional).
- `files(("photo", "path/to/file/photo.jpg", "image/jpeg"),
  ("photo details", '{"name":"prasanth"}', "application/json")   
  )`

  for multipart upload
  **dothttp** will figure out content type by going through file/data, when type is not mentioned.

### Comments

**dothttp** will use `#` for commenting entire line.

1. `//` line comment. follows java, javascript
2. `#` line comment. follows python's comment style
3. `/*
   */` multi line comment. follows java/javascript style

### Templating

```.http
POST 'http://localhost:8000/post'
? ("{{key}}", "{{value}}")
data('{"{{key}}" :"{{value}}"}', 'application/json')
```

- specify variable values through property file ([sample.json](./examples/.dothttp.json)).
    - user can define environments and can activate multiple environments at a time
    - **dothttp** by default will read variables from `"*"` section
    - for example
      `dothttp --property-file path/to/file.json --env ram chandra`

      will activate `*` section properties, `ram` section properties and `chandra` section properties
      `dothttp --env ram chandra`
      will activate `*` section properties, `ram` section properties and `chandra` section properties
      from `.dothttp.json` in httpfile name space
- through command line
  `dothttp --property key=ram value=ranga`
  will replace `{{ram}}` to `ranga` from the file
- through file itself. (will be helpful for default properties)

```
POST 'https://{{host=httpbin.org}}/post'
```

### Headers

User can define headers in below three formats

1. `header('content-type', 'application/json')` readable
2. `'content-type': 'application/json'` concise
3. property file `headers` section from property-file can also be used. in most scenarios, headers section will be
   common for a host. having them in property file would ease them.

### Authentication

#### BasicAuth
`basicauth('username','password')'` --> will compute add respective headers.

#### DigestAuth
`digestauth('username','password')'` --> will compute add respective headers.

#### NtlmAuth
`ntlmauth('username','password')'` --> will compute add respective headers.

### Property file

```json
{
  "*": {
    "host": "httpbin.org"
  },
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "plain/text"
  },
  "preprod": {
    "host": "preprod.httpbin.org"
  }
}
```

#### Special sections in property file

1. `*` section in property file will be activated once user specifies property file if user didn't specifiy file
   and `.dothttp.json` exists, it will be activated
2. `headers` once a property file is activated. headers from property file will be added to request by default without
   user having to specify in `.http` file

#### Formatter (experimental phase)

**dothttp** can format a http file using below command
`dothttp -fmt examples/dothttpazure.http --experimental`
or
`dothttp --format examples/dothttpazure.http --experimental`

to print to command line

`dothttp --format examples/dothttpazure.http --experimental --stdout`
