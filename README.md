# Inspiration

With the rise in usage of microservices, using http/curl is essential part of most developer's jobs. There are multiple options out there (some are curl, postmant) . My Ideal choice would be to use curl but problems with it is having no history. Postman solves that problem but once user logs in, postman actually syncs it to their servers which i did not like. 

## GOAL
dothttp will provide simple, cleaner architecture for making http requests. It uses xtext (eclipse developed dsl) to build a custom dsl.
